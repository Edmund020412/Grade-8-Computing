    <h3>Student Rights</h3>
        

        <p>
            Student rights are the legal and ethical entitlements students have within an educational institution, encompassing freedoms like speech and association, as well as rights to due process, safety, privacy, and equal access to education. These rights ensure fair treatment and protect students from discrimination while allowing them to engage in their education fully and receive high-quality instruction and support.
